	     <font color="blue" face="Arial" size="5">Kurt Vonegut is one of my favorite authors. One of his most well know books is <i>Welcome To The Monkey House</i>, a collection of short stories that will make you laugh, make you cry, make you fall asleep, or maybe even make you pull your hair out! However you react, you <strong>WILL</strong> have a reaction!

		 <font color="#FF0000" face="Calibri" size="5">Vonegut is an interesting author, one of the few that has interjected himself in his works of fiction. In one of his most well known novels, <b><i>Breakfast Of Champions</i></b>, he meets one of his fictional characters. It is a very comical situation, especially since the character has so much in common with the author. In fact, this particular character, named <b><u>Kilgore Trout</b></u>, is Vonegut's avatar in the world he created, and the fact that the author and his creation get along so poorly is pretty hilarious, and a reflection of Vonegut's self depricating sense of humor.</font>
